  Spawns and connects to CNode `cnode_name` from application `app`.

  The CNode is passed the following command line arguments:
  - host name,
  - alive name,
  - node name,
  - cookie,
  - creation number.

  After CNode startup, these parameters should be passed to
  [`ei_connect_xinit`](http://erlang.org/doc/man/ei_connect.html#ei_connect_xinit)
  function, and CNode should be published and await connection. Once the CNode is
  published, it should print a line starting with `ready` to the standard output
  **and flush the standard output** to avoid the line being buffered.

  Under the hood, this function starts an associated server, which is responsible
  for monitoring the CNode and monitoring calling process to be able to do proper
  cleanup upon a crash. On startup, the server does the following:
  1. Makes current node distributed if it is not done yet (see `Node.start/3`).
  1. Assigns CNode a unique name.
  1. Starts CNode OS process using `Port.open/2`.
  1. Waits (at most 5 seconds) until a line `ready` is printed out
  (this line is captured and not forwarded to the stdout).
  1. Connects to the CNode.
